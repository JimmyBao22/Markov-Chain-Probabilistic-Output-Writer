# Markov-Chain-Probabilistic-Output-Writer

Explores the idea of using random writing to produce text that is similar to some known piece
of work. Imagine taking a book, such as Tom Sawyer, and determining the probability with which each character
occurs. You’d probably find that spaces are the most common character, followed by the character e, etc. Given
these probabilities, which we will call a Level 0 analysis, you could randomly produce text that, while not resembling
English, would have the property that the characters would likely occur in the same proportions as they do in Tom
Sawyer. For example, here’s what you might produce:

Level 0 rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te u t mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee

Now imagine a slightly more sophisticated Level 1 analysis that determines the probability with which each character follows every other character. You would likely discover that h follows t more frequently than x does, and you
would probably discover that a q is likely followed by a u. With this new analysis, you could use the probabilities from
Tom Sawyer to randomly pick an initial character and then repeatedly choose the next character based on the previous
character and the probabilities provided by the analysis. Your new text will look a bit more like English:

Level 1 “Shand tucthiney m?” le ollds mind Theybooue He, he s whit Pereg lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids
tre lin-p asto oun theanthadomoere

We can generalize these ideas to a Level k analysis that determines the probability with which each character
follows every possible sequence of k characters. For example, a Level 5 analysis of Tom Sawyer would show that r
follows Sawye more frequently than any other character. After a Level k analysis, you’d be able to produce random
text by always choosing the next character based on the previous k characters – which we will call the seed – and
based on the probabilities produced by your analysis. As the value of k increases, the text looks increasingly like
English. Here are some more examples:

Level 2 “Yess been.” for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of an’te cle - armit. Paper a comeasione, and smomenty,
